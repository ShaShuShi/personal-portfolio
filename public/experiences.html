                            project in excel, which took our data from Jira and Confluence to understand the current state of deployment, what
                            business processes are available in the ERP, and which deployments need to be prioritized.

                                This was my first corporate proffessional experience in Software Engineering.  In this role, I was guided 
                                by my mentor during the early stages, but immediately after made innovative impacts of my own. I added went beyond 
                                expectations and updated an application beyond the the request for functionality, but also increased the scalability 
                                potential of the app by introducing master pages, reducing the time spent by a future developer. My developed applications 
                                were released for UAT and then officially released, and to this day are still being utilized.
