                        <ul>
                            <li>Integrated open source weather API and RESTful OpenAI API</li>
                            <li>Developed virtual closet using SQL for data storage.</li>
                            <li>Created frontend using React to display output from OpenAI API along with take in input safely for closet updates and send http requests between backend via Flask</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Challenges:</h4>
                        <p>
                            One of the biggest hurdles was to address security with my API keys. To resolve this, I use System variables. There also lots of debugging in getting 
                            frontend to interact properly with backend. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Learning Outcome:</h4>
                        <p>
                            I gained a deep understanding of integrating APIs securely and efficiently. Debugging frontend-backend communication gave me confidence in building scalable web applications.
                            Working with OpenAI API and solving real-world challenges taught me to think critically about user experience and data handling.

                        <h4>Challenges:</h4>
                        <p>
                            This took time to get together and I came across challenges when it came to reactive components I wanted to add. For 
                            example, the timeline tiles fading in and the experienc and project tiles expanding on click were things I wanted to add, but 
                            did not know how. I was able to use online documentation to learn how to apply those features. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Learning Outcome:</h4>
                        <p>
                            This project strengthened my skills in creating interactive user interfaces and working with MVC architecture. I learned how to implement dynamic components like expanding tiles
                            and animations, making the site more engaging. It also improved my ability to use documentation and online resources to solve problems creatively.

                        <h4>Challenges:</h4>
                        <p>
                            This project was near the beginning of my very first Software internship, and as such, I took advantage of 
                            the mentorship that was available to me. There was a learning curve for me in .NET technologies, but my mentor did 
                            phenomenal job in getting me up to speed in just 2-weeks! Other challenges I faced were with various bugs in the code 
                            that I reviewed with my mentor to locate.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Learning Outcome:</h4>
                        <p>
                            This experience helped me develop foundational skills in .NET technologies and SQL databases. It also taught me the importance of seeking mentorship, which accelerated my
                            learning curve. Debugging and resolving bugs improved my attention to detail and problem-solving abilities.

                        <p>
                               The most significant challenge for this portion was understanding the needs of the finance team and how to best 
                               implement that in the software. Besides that, there were bugs, many of which I was able to resolve on my own, 
                               few that I needed support from my mentor on. 
                        </p>

                                This project was what elevated by beginner Power BI acumen to intermediate. There were several technical challenges and learning 
                                hurdles I needed to overcome along the process.  I met with a professional to discuss my project and view some of their work. I also learned 
                                from many online resources on best practices and helpful tips and tricks for design and layout. Normalizing and transforming the data was definitely 
                                a challenge as at times normalization could lead to a loss of information, so many disucssions were had on what approach might be most beneficial.

                        <h4>Challenges:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, I did not have the connector to ServiceNow, so I needed to be clever about how I recognized PC Pickup tickets. 
                            This workaround added extra moving parts which created some ineffeciencies, but ultimately it still achieved the desired 
                            functionality. Another challenge was to address all the niche conditions that could occur with a PC Pickup ticket.  Although most 
                            of these were addressed in the initial deployment, a few of them were revealed during UAT and were promptly resolved. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Learning Outcome:</h4>
                        <p>
                            This project taught me to think creatively when faced with technical limitations, such as not having direct ServiceNow connectors. I learned how to handle edge cases
                            in automation workflows and gained a better understanding of how to manage user expectations through thorough testing and iterative improvements.

                    <p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Power BI, Daptiv Reporting</p>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong>Engineered a dashboard that gives insight in the resource costs over a 90 day period, which updates quickly. </p>
                    <p><strong>Impact:</strong>Turned a 5 hour process of developing a new excel report each week into a 5 minute process through Power BI, thus saving 98% of the time 
                        for this process. Allows for PMO leadership to quickly understand how costs are allocated to business resources and locate points of concern.</p>

                            <li>Reassesed an existing process and improved it by using Power BI reporting</li>
                            <li>Designed friendly visualization in excel to simply very nuanced data.</li>
                            <li>Refresh data bi-weekly and report out with just a single button click</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Challenges:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Before beginning this project, I finished the Consolidated Dashboard project which gave an opportunity to really hone my Power BI accumen. 
                            Still, I ran into some brand new challenges I had not encountered previously on the tool, which took some time to resolve and ultimately taught me new things about the tool.
                            A lot of the data also needed to be normalized, which at times causes information to get lost. This added time to the planning stage which added delays.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Learning Outcome:</h4>
                        <p>
                            This project deepened my understanding of Power BI and showed me the importance of improving existing processes. I learned how to manage large datasets, normalize them
                            effectively, and create intuitive visualizations that convey complex information clearly to stakeholders.

                            <li>Reviewed 1300 Jira Change Requests to understand business needs.</li>
                            <li>Designed friendly visualization in excel to simply very nuanced data.</li>

                        <h4>Challenges:</h4>
                        <p>
                            It took time and understanding to be able to fine tune the visuals in the excel report and also the 
                            final report to senior leadership. In addition, understanding the data and fields in Jira to be able 
                            to create the appropriate filters was challenging since the fields were not the most intuitive. Another challenge was that 
                            to confirm certain intuitions, I needed to meet with busy process owners, which added significant delays.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Learning Outcome:</h4>
                        <p>
                            I honed my data analysis skills and learned how to create impactful visuals in Excel for senior leadership. Navigating Jira data fields taught me how to extract
                            meaningful information from complex systems. This experience also improved my ability to communicate insights effectively to a non-technical audience.
